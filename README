SETI/WebStats version 1.01
==========================

A Perl interface to the SETI@home web server.

SETI::WebStats queries the SETI@home web server and retrieves user
statistics.  The data availible from the server is similar to that
displayed on the 'Individual User Statistics' web page.  In order
to query the server, you will need a valid SETI@home account i.e
e-mail address.  At this time only user statistics are availible.
A later version might incorporate country/group statistics also.
